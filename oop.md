#### Objects 
* the things you work with in code;
* instances of classes (based on the classes);
* class based creation is an alternative to using object literals;

#### Classes
* blueprints for objects; 
* define how objects look like, which properties an methods the have;
* classes make creation of multiple, similar objects much easier;
