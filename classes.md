#### Inheritance 
* can only inherit from one class;
* class that inherits automatically gets all the same that base class;
* with 'constructor' we can create additional, uniuqe parts of the new class;
* 'super' calls the constructor of the base class!
* you can override properties from base class;
* child class does NOT inherit private properties from its parent;
