TS uses static types => set (once for all) in development; Supported during development; Not after compiling;

Unlike JS that uses 'dynamic types';

**TYPES:**

+ numbers - all numbers, no differentiation between integers or floats; 1, 5.3, -10;

+ string - all text values; 'Hi', "Hi", `Hi`;

+ boolean - only true & false; no 'truthy' or 'falsy' value;

+ objects  - any JS object; can be defined as type 'object' just by assigning object to a const; but more specific objects can be possible;

+ array - any JS array; type can be 
    - flexible;
    - strict;

+ tuple - array with fixed number of elements;
