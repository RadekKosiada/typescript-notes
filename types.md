TS uses static types => set (once for all) in development; Supported during development; Not after compiling;

Unlike JS that uses 'dynamic types';

**TYPES:**

+ numbers - all numbers, no differentiation between integers or floats; 1, 5.3, -10;

+ string - all text values; 'Hi', "Hi", `Hi`;

+ boolean - only true & false; no 'truthy' or 'falsy' value;

+ objects  - any JS object; can be defined as type 'object' just by assigning object to a const; but more specific objects can be possible;

+ array - any JS array; type can be 
    - flexible;
    - strict;

+ tuple - array with fixed number of elements;

+ enum - enumerated list, custom type, often uppercase, but lower case is also correct;

+ any;

+ union - defined with '|';

+ literal types - variables, where not only type, but also the very value is defined!;

+ custom type - can have any name, but no key words used in JS i.e. Date...

+ void - for functions that have no return statement; for example if we only log things in the console;

+ undefined - is a value itself; so doesn't equal void;

+ Function 
    - type to declare on functions, to make sure they are not defined; 
    - '...' spread operator when don't know how many arguments do we pass;

+ unknown - cannot be assigned to string;
https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-0.html#new-unknown-top-type
Anything is assignable to unknown, but unknown isnâ€™t assignable to anything but itself and any without a type assertion or a control flow based narrowing. 

+ any - to define type of variables that we do not know when we are writing an application;

+ never; 
    - for a function that always crashes script or a part of it and never returns anything, even not an 'undefined';
    - can be also void; but 'never' is better;


+ null; 

+ generics;
